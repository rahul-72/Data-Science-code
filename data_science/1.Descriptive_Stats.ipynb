In many cases we turn these ordinal variables into numbers, as we can more easily analyze them, but more on this later!\n",

    "#### Important Final Points\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance is used to compare the spread of two different groups. A set of data with higher variance is more spread out than a dataset with lower variance. Be careful though, there might just be an outlier (or outliers) that is increasing the variance, when most of the data are actually very close.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the spread between two datasets, the units of each must be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When data are related to money or the economy, higher variance (or standard deviation) is associated with higher risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is used more often in practice than the variance, because it shares the units of the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Use in the World\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is associated with risk in finance, assists in determining the significance of drugs in medical studies, and measures the error of our results for predicting anything from the amount of rainfall we can expect tomorrow to your predicted commute time tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "These applications are beyond the scope of this course as they pertain to specific fields, but know that understanding the spread of a particular set of data is extremely important to many areas. In this lesson you mastered the calculation of the most common measures of spread.\n",

    "When analyzing categorical variables, we commonly just look at the count or percent of a group that falls into each level of a category. For example, if we had two levels of a dog category: lab and not lab. We might say, 32% of the dogs were lab (percent), or we might say 32 of the 100 dogs I saw were labs (count).\n",

    "However, the 4 aspects associated with describing quantitative variables are not used to describe categorical variables.\n",

    "###### Quantitative Variables\n",

    "Then we learned there are four main aspects used to describe quantitative variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Measures of Center\n",
    "    Measures of Spread\n",
    "    Shape of the Distribution\n",
    "    Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "###### We looked at calculating measures of Center\n",
    "\n",
    "    Means\n",
    "    Medians\n",
    "    Modes\n",
    "    \n",
    "###### We also looked at calculating measures of Spread\n",
    "\n",
    "Range\n",
    "    Interquartile Range\n",
    "    Standard Deviation\n",
    "    Variance\n",
    "    Calculating Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### We saw that we could calculate the variance as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also see:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} $$\n",
    " \n",

    "The reason for this is beyond the scope of what we have covered thus far, but you can find an explanation here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can commonly find answers to your questions with a quick Google search. Now is a great time to get started with this practice! This answer should make more sense at the completion of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Deviation vs. Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. In practice, you usually use the standard deviation rather than the variance. The reason for this is because the standard deviation shares the same units with our original data, while the variance has squared units.\n",

    "\n",

Many career paths involving Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are aimed at using collected data to draw conclusions about entire populations at an individual level. It is an exciting time to be a part of this space, and you are now well on your way to joining the other practitioners!\n"
